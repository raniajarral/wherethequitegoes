      <p>When people hear the word pollution, most think of garbage on the streets or smoke from vehicles. Few realize that sound itself can become a pollutant. The loudest sound ever recorded, the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883, ruptured eardrums from forty miles away. Thatâ€™s how powerful sound can be. Now imagine smaller but constant noises surrounding us every day. That is noise pollution.</p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <section class="story-section">
      <p>Noise pollution happens when sound levels rise high enough to disrupt normal life or harm living beings. It is often ignored because it leaves no visible trace, but its effects are deep and lasting. Constant exposure to loud sounds like traffic, construction, or machinery causes stress, hearing problems, and sleep disturbances. Over time, it can lead to heart issues and mental fatigue. People who live in noisy environments often struggle to focus or rest properly.</p>

    <section class="story-section">
      <p>Despite all this, noise pollution is not something we are powerless against. Many of the actions we take to heal the environment can also quiet the world around us. Planting trees, for instance, not only absorbs carbon but also softens and blocks unwanted sound, turning busy streets into calmer spaces. Building noise barriers along highways, adopting electric vehicles, and improving public transportation all reduce both air and noise pollution. When fewer cars fill the roads, cities breathe easier and sound gentler.</p>

    <section class="story-section">
      <p>So the question remains: where does the quiet go? It slips away when we stop noticing. If we learn to value silence as we value clean air and clear water, we can bring it back. Quiet is not the absence of life; it is what allows life to be heard.</p>
